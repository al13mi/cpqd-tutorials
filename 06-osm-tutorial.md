# Exercises - OSM

These exercises will make you feel comfortable with OSM.

This exercise is based on OSM Documentation Tutorials: https://osm.etsi.org/docs/user-guide/04-vim-setup.html#what-if-i-do-not-have-a-vim-at-hand-use-of-sandboxes. 

For more info and tutorials, check https://osm.etsi.org/wikipub/index.php/Latest_OSM_Hackfest_Material


This exercise is divided in three parts:

1. Starting OSM
2. An Emulated OSM VIM
3. Deploying a NSD

## Part 1: Understanding the OSM components

Open a terminal and start OSM:

```bash
$ docker stack deploy -c /etc/osm/docker/docker-compose.yaml osm
```

Expect the following service to be started:

Creating service 
 osm_mongo
 osm_nbi
 osm_kafka
 osm_grafana
 osm_prometheus-cadvisor
 osm_pol
 osm_prometheus
 osm_zookeeper
 osm_mon
 osm_mysql
 osm_light-ui
 osm_ro
 osm_keystone
 osm_lcm


Check the started osm service containers.

```bash
$ docker stack ps osm | grep -i running
```

Open the browser, and enter the OSM web UI at http://127.0.0.1/ with login admin and password admin. 


## Part 2: An Emulated OSM VIM

Vim-emu emulation platform was created to support network service developers to locally prototype and test their network services in realistic end-to-end multi-PoP scenarios. It allows the execution of real network functions, packaged as Docker containers, in emulated network topologies running locally on the developerâ€™s machine. The emulation platform also offers OpenStack-like APIs for each emulated PoP so that it can integrate with MANO solutions, like OSM. The core of the emulation platform is based on Containernet.


:::warning
Known limitations of VIM Emulator: 

* VIM Emulator requires special VM images, suitable for running in a VIM Emulator environment.
* Day-1 and Day-2 procedures of OSM are a work in progress in VIM Emulator, and hence are not available as of the date of this publication.
:::

Notice, if you plan to use this emulation platform for academic publications, please cite the following paper:

* M. Peuster, H. Karl, and S. v. Rossem: MeDICINE: Rapid Prototyping of Production-Ready Network Services in Multi-PoP Environments. IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN), Palo Alto, CA, USA, pp. 148-153. doi: 10.1109/NFV-SDN.2016.7919490. (2016)

In the host machine, check if the emulator is running:

```bash
$ docker ps | grep vim-emu
```

If not, start it with the following command:

```bash
$ docker run --name vim-emu -t -d --rm --privileged --pid='host' --network=netosm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock vim-emu-img python examples/osm_default_daemon_topology_2_pop.py
```

You need to set the correct environment variables, i.e., you need to get the IP address of the vim-emu container to be able to add it as a VIM to your OSM installation:

```bash
$ export VIMEMU_HOSTNAME=$(sudo docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' vim-emu)
```

Attach OSM to vim-emu

```bash=
$ osm vim-create --name emu-vim1 --user username --password password --auth_url http://$VIMEMU_HOSTNAME:6001/v2.0 --tenant tenantName --account_type openstack
 
$ osm vim-list
```


## Part 3: Deploying a NSD

Onboarding the VNFs Descriptors

```bash
$ osm vnfd-create vim-emu/examples/vnfs/ping.tar.gz
$ osm vnfd-create vim-emu/examples/vnfs/pong.tar.gz
```

Onboarding the NSD

```bash
$ osm nsd-create vim-emu/examples/services/pingpong_nsd.tar.gz
```


You can now check OSM's GUI to see the VNFs and NS in the catalog. Or:

```bash
$ osm vnfd-list

$ osm nsd-list
```


Check the OSM GUI interface. Click in the left side of the screen, Packages -> VNF Packages or NS Packages.
There you should see the ping and pong VNFDs and the pingpong NSD.



Instantiate example pingpong service

```bash
$ osm ns-create --nsd_name pingpong --ns_name test --vim_account emu-vim1
```


Check service instance using OSM client

```bash
$ osm ns-list
```

Interact with deployed VNFs

```bash
$ docker exec -it mn.dc1_test-1-ubuntu-1 /bin/bash
```

Ping the pong VNF over the attached management network

```bash
#root@dc1_test-1-ubuntu-1:/# ping 192.168.100.4
```

Delete the deployed service.

```bash
$ osm ns-delete test
```


Connect to vim-emu Docker container to see its logs ( do in another terminal window).

```bash
$ docker logs -f vim-emu
```

Check if the emulator is running in the container.

```bash
$ docker exec vim-emu vim-emu datacenter list
```

Check the running service.

```bash
$ docker exec vim-emu vim-emu compute list
```

To stop the OSM service stack


```bash
$ docker stack rm osm && sleep 60
```

And stop/delete the vim-emu container.

```bash
$ docker stop -t0 vim-emu

$ docker rm vim-emu
```

## Congratulations!

Now you know a little about OSM!
